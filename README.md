## Quickstart

1. Clone repository.

	- change directory (cd) to your projects or development folder

		```
		cd ~/Development
		```

	- clone the repository and cd into the repository folder

		```
		git clone git@github.com:AlJohri/onondaga-e911.git
		cd onondaga-e911
		```

	- Run all commands below from the `onondaga-e911` folder.

2. Install dependencies.
	
	```
	brew install jq python node
	pip3 install awscli pipenv
	npm install -g serverless
	pipenv install
	npm install
	```

3. Set up AWS.

	- Create an AWS account: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup
	- Get the root credentials for your account and keep them in a safe place: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential
	- Add these credentials to the aws command line. Run this command and follow the steps:

		```
		aws configure
		```

		- If you don't know what region to choose, set it to `us-east-1`.
		- If you already have a separate AWS account setup append ` --profile <profile>` to `aws configure`.

		For additional help, see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html

		‚ö†Ô∏è It's not best practice to directly use the root credentials. You ideally want to create an IAM user with just the permissions it needs. Please see [docs/iam.md](./docs/iam.md) for instructions on how to do this. ‚ö†Ô∏è

4. Create `.env` file.

	```
	touch .env
	```

	If you are using the `default` aws profile, just leave the file blank. Otherwise, open the file and write `AWS_PROFILE=xyz` (where `xyz` is the name of your profile) into the first line of the file and save.

5. Deploy the stack with serverless.

	```
	pipenv run serverless deploy -v
	```

	Prefixing with `pipenv run` loads the environment variables that we just set in the `.env` file and then runs the command `serverless deploy`.

	When you're ready to deploy to production add, `--stage prod` to the end of the deploy command.

## Data

I recommend reading the [caveats](./docs/caveats.md) in detail before using this data.

**UI**

_Chrome Only_

- **Dev**: https://s3.amazonaws.com/onondaga-e911-dev/index.html
- **Prod**: https://s3.amazonaws.com/onondaga-e911-prod/index.html

**DynamoDB Tables**

- `onondaga-e911-all-(dev|prod)`
- `onondaga-e911-closed-(dev|prod)`
- `onondaga-e911-pending-(dev|prod)`

**S3 Folders**:

- `s3://onondaga-e911-(dev|prod)/all/`
- `s3://onondaga-e911-(dev|prod)/closed/`
- `s3://onondaga-e911-(dev|prod)/pending/`

## Usage

üö® Start `pipenv shell` before starting to run ANY of the commands below. This will start a python virtualenv and set the environment variables (`.env`) properly. üö®

### Download Data from S3

#### Download Single Date

```
aws s3 cp s3://onondaga-e911-dev/all/2018-05-17.json .
```

#### Download all data for "closed" page

```
aws s3 sync s3://onondaga-e911-dev/closed .
```

#### Download everything

```
aws s3 sync s3://onondaga-e911-dev .
```

### Download Data directly from DynamoDB

This is a bit more complicated because of the cost structure for DynamoDB. See [docs/dynamodb.md](./docs/dynamodb.md) for more details.

### Check Logs

```
serverless logs --function scrape_all --tail
serverless logs --function scrape_closed --tail
serverless logs --function archive_all --tail
serverless logs --function archive_closed --tail
serverless logs --function archive_pending --tail
```

### Running locally

```
serverless invoke local --function scrape_all
serverless invoke local --function scrape_closed
serverless invoke local --function archive_all
serverless invoke local --function archive_closed
serverless invoke local --function archive_pending
```

### Undeploy All

üö® This will delete the data (dynamo tables and s3 bucket)! üö®

For `dev` stage:

```
aws s3 rm --recursive s3://onondaga-e911-dev # need to delete contents before bucket
serverless remove -v
```

For `prod` stage: don't do it!
